# Library Management System â€“ OOP Assignment

## Description
This program models a simple **library management system** using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles in Python.  
It allows members to **borrow** and **return** books while tracking book availability.

## Features
- **Classes:** `Book`, `Member`, `PremiumMember`  
- **OOP Concepts Demonstrated:**  
  - Encapsulation (private attributes with getters)  
  - Inheritance (`PremiumMember` extends `Member`)  
  - Polymorphism (overridden `display_info` method)  
  - Composition (`Member` has a list of borrowed books)  
- Borrow and return books  
- Display information for books and members  

## Usage of The Code
1. Run the main Python file (`main.py`).  
2. Sample books and members are created automatically.  
3. Borrow and return books, and display member/book information.  

## Optional Enhancements
- File input/output to save and load data  
- Exception handling for invalid actions
