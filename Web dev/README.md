# Mastering JavaScript Fundamentals

## Overview
This assignment focuses on core JavaScript concepts including **variables**, **conditionals**, **functions**, **loops**, and **DOM manipulation**. You’ll learn how to make web pages interactive and dynamic using pure JavaScript.

## Assignment Parts

### Part 1: JavaScript Basics
- Practice variables, data types, operators, and conditionals.
- Capture user input, make decisions, and display results via `console.log` or page updates.

### Part 2: Functions
- Create reusable functions to process data and perform common tasks.
- Examples: calculating totals, formatting strings, toggling content.

### Part 3: Loops
- Use `for`, `while`, or `forEach` to handle repetition.
- Examples: iterating arrays, generating dynamic content, countdowns.

### Part 4: DOM Manipulation
- Select and modify HTML elements dynamically.
- Handle events like clicks and key presses.
- Create or update elements on the fly to improve interactivity.

## Deliverables
- `index.html` — HTML structure  
- `style.css` — optional styling  
- `script.js` — JavaScript including:
  - Variable declarations & conditionals
  - At least 2 custom functions
  - At least 2 loop examples
  - At least 3 DOM interactions

## Goals
- Demonstrate understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- Build reusable and readable code
- Enhance web page interactivity with DOM manipulation

# Assignment: HTML5 + Accessibility & SEO Basics

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio web page built as part of the **"HTML5 + Accessibility & SEO Basics"** assignment. The main objective was to apply semantic HTML5 structure, accessibility principles, and on-page SEO practices in building a clean, accessible, and discoverable web page.

## Objective

To demonstrate a solid understanding of semantic HTML5 while ensuring the page is:

- **Accessible** for screen readers and assistive technologies
- **SEO-friendly** for better search engine indexing
- **Well-structured** using appropriate semantic tags
- **Human-readable** with a clear, organized layout

---

## Project Description

The web page showcases the my portfolio. It is divided into multiple semantic sections:

### 🔹 Header

- Contains the website title using `<h1>` and the primary navigation using the `<nav>` element.
- Navigation links enable smooth in-page navigation to **About**, **Projects**, **Skills**, and **Contact** sections.

### 🔹 Main Content

#### About Section

- Introduces the developer with a welcome message and a professional summary.
- Includes a downloadable CV link enhanced with a download icon.

#### Projects Section

- Utilizes `<article>` and `<section>` elements to describe individual project cards:
  - **Library Manager System**
  - **Blog Post Website**
  - **Demographic Data Collection App**
- Each card contains an image and placeholder project descriptions (to be replaced with actual content).

#### Skills Section

- Lists core technical skills using semantic list tags.

#### Contact Section

- Provides an email address and a contact form with appropriate input labels for accessibility.

### 🔹 Footer

- Ends with a copyright notice.

---

## Accessibility Features

- Use of **semantic elements** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper **heading hierarchy** (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) for screen reader navigation
- Form inputs use associated `<label>` tags
- Meaningful `alt` text for all images

---

## SEO Enhancements

- Descriptive `<meta name="description">` for search engine snippets
- Clean and readable content structure
- Relevant heading tags and page title
- Anchor links to improve site navigation and internal linking

---

## Deliverables

✅ `index.html` file including:

- ✅ Semantic HTML5 layout  
- ✅ SEO-friendly metadata and headings  
- ✅ Accessibility-conscious design  
- ✅ Downloadable CV link
